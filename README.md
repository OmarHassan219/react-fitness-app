Built a list of workouts app that allows you to explore different workouts ,
based on target muscle , machine and the relevant exercises .With animations and some related videos from YouTube , Responsive to all Screens.
Built the website using nextjs, CMS (Sanity) , CSS, and Stripe API

The idea is to gather all exercises whether it is a home workout or it requires
a gym machine to make it easier to search the needed exercise depending on the target muscle or machine.
In addition, there is also a section for youtube videos 
that shows some channels showing the selected exercise
